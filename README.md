# Dash Components Archetype

This is a [Builder][] archetype for [Dash][] component suites.
This project enables Dash Component Authors to easily generate the code
necessary to create a custom Dash component.

This project uses [Builder] to provide the necessary templating 


It defines build-
and test configuration, as well as development scripts and a convenient way to
generate a new component suite project with all the necessary boilerplate.
